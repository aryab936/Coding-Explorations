This is the Revolut Home Task that is given when one interviews at Revolut. The data and the details of the challenge are widely available on the internet. The exact same challenge is also posed by Revolut's competitor N26.  
The challenge has two sub problems:
1. Doing Data Analysis to understand why KYC completion rates are low.
2. Using SQL and other methods to detect potential fraudsters in the signup process.

For the first task, various python analysis tools were used like pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib.
For the second task, a random forest model was created and SQL queries were also used in the process.

The Code files/KYC directory contains the Jupyter Notebooks that did the data exploration, visualisation and found some interesting insights.
The Main Task Challenge.docx(1).pdf outlines the task that was needed to be completed.
The Task Reports folder outlines the report I wrote and the summary of my findings and deductions based on the codes written.
