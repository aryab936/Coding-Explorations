This is the Revolut Home Task that was given to me when I interviewed at Revolut for the position of a Junior Operations Manager in India. 
The challenge had two sub problems:
1. Doing Data Analysis to understand why KYC completion rates are low.
2. Using SQL and other methods to detect potential fraudsters in the signup process.

For the first task, various python analysis tools were used like pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib.
For the second task, a random forest model was created and SQL queries were also used in the process.

The Code files/KYC directory contains the Jupyter Notebooks that did the data exploration, visualisation and found some interesting insights.
The Main Task Challenge.docx(1).pdf outlines the task that was needed to be completed.
The Task Reports folder outlines the report I wrote and the summary of my findings and deductions based on the codes written.
