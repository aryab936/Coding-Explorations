This is the Revolut Home Task that was given to me when I interviewed at Revolut for the position of a Junior Operations Manager in India. 
The challenge had two sub problems:
1. Doing Data Analysis to understand why KYC completion rates are low.
2. Using SQL and other methods to detect potential fraudsters in the signup process.
