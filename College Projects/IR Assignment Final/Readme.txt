This model uses the concepts of Statistical Machine Learning to implement translations on a parallel corpus to obtain translations of the provided Dutch corpus.

The text is first cleaned and 2 different files CleanEnglish.txt and DistinctDutch.txt are created.

These are the files actually used for training the model.

To run the trained, first run the file 'FinalFileSplitter.py'.

Then  run the file 'FinalProject.py' which contains the actual implementation of the IBM Model 1 and some more innovative strategies.

To  translate a given sentence, use the interactive prompt to enter the language to be translated to (destination language) and the text to be translate.

The translated text would be shown ini the prompt.

The file 'Metrics.py' contain implementations of Jaccard similarity and Cosine similarity used to estimamte the performance of the model.
