This directory has 3 sub directories which are about three college projects that my friends and I did as a part of our college curriculum. I will briefly outline all of them here:
1. The directory Compiler_Project contains all the files that are related to the project for the course Compiler Construction completed in BITS Pilani. The task was to build a lexer for our compiler and the language allowed for use was C programming language.
2. The IR Assignment Final directory contains all files(except data files) that are from the Information Retrieval Course in BITS Pilani. We were tasked with the implementation of IBM Model 1 for statistical machine translation.
3. Logic_Programming_Using_Prolog: This directory contains all the code and assignment specification related to an assigment given as a part of the Logic in Computer Science Course in BITS Pilani. The langauge used for the project was SWI Prolog.
