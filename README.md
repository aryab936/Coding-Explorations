# Code Samples
These are samples codes that I have written in the past. Kindly note that these codes are only for evaluation purposes and is strictly meant for the receiver of the link to this repository. Most of the code samples are either based on exercises that were completed as a part of preparation for an interview process or are from the projects I have worked/am currently working at Sabudh Foundation, Mohali.

Please Note: Written permission has been taken to share the codes that are relevant to the projects at Sabudh Foundation. There are also some college project codes that have been added to the repository to showcase the work I have done.If you wish to share the code, please do so after taking written permission.
