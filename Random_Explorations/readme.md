This is the random explorations directory that is aimed to provide you with just a few of the random Python Notebooks I have created outside work.

The directory contains 4 Python Notebooks and here I will outline what each of them is all about.

1. Fitting Distributions: This notebook deals with the fitting of a known statistical distribution on a random dataset. Two methods, one being the method of moments and the other being maximum likelihood estimate were used to approximately fit a normal distribution. The confidence intervals for two standard parameters of the normal distribution: mean and variance were then calculated using bootstrapping. A lot of inspiration and guidance was taken from one of my colleagues at Sabudh while working on this notebook as he had already worked on the same earlier.
2. HR_Analytics_Job_Change_of_Data_Scientists: This notebook attempts to look at various approaches possible for this Kaggle Challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/hr-analytics-job-change-of-data-scientists
3. Monte_Carlo_Simulation: This notebook does a monte carlo simulation to verify a specific experiment widely observed in textbooks dealing with the theory of joint distributions.
4. Rain in Australia: This notebook was supposed to be a solution notebook to the Kaggle Dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package), but it has not been completed yet.
